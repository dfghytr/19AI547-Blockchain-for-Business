# Experiment 4: DeFi Lending and Borrowing Protocol
# Aim:
To build a decentralized lending protocol where users can deposit assets to earn interest and borrow assets by providing collateral. This experiment introduces concepts like overcollateralization, liquidity pools, and interest accrual in DeFi.

# Algorithm:
step 1: Users send Ether to the contract via deposit(), which adds the amount to their balance and emits a Deposited event.

step 2: Users call borrow(amount) and must provide at least 150% of the loan amount as collateral. The contract transfers the borrowed Ether to the user and records the debt.

step 3: Anyone can call liquidate(borrower) if a user's collateral falls below 150% of their debt. The liquidator receives the borrowerâ€™s collateral.

step 4: Every deposit, borrow, and liquidation emits an event to ensure transparency and traceability on the blockchain.

If collateral < 150% of borrowed amount, liquidators can seize the collateral.

# High-Level Overview:
Teaches key DeFi concepts: lending, borrowing, collateral, liquidation.


Introduces risk management: overcollateralization and liquidation.


Directly related to DeFi protocols like Aave and Compound.

# RESULT :
To build a decentralized lending protocol where users can deposit assets to earn interest and borrow assets by providing collateral. This experiment introduces concepts like overcollateralization, liquidity pools, and interest accrual in DeFi completed successfully
