# Ex No: 3 - Supply Chain Transparency for Luxury Goods
## Name : Abdul kalaam k m
## Reg No: 212223230003
## Date : 21-04-2025
# Aim:
To develop a smart contract that tracks the supply chain of luxury goods, ensuring authenticity.
# Algorithm:
## step 1:
Manufacturer inputs productId and name, and registers the product if it's not already registered.
## step 2:
Contract stores the product with name, msg.sender as currentOwner, and sets verified = true.
## step 3:
For ownership transfer, contract checks if msg.sender is the current owner of the product.
## step 4:
If valid, contract updates currentOwner to the new owner's address and emits an event.
## step 5:
Repeat the ownership transfer at each supply chain checkpoint by authorized parties.
## step 6:
Buyer or verifier inputs productId to retrieve product details from the smart contract.
## step 7:
Contract returns the productâ€™s name, currentOwner, and verified status for authenticity check.
## step 8:
All actions (registration and transfers) are permanently recorded on-chain for transparency and trust.

# Expected Output:
A luxury good (e.g., a Rolex watch) is registered on-chain.

Ownership is transferred at every checkpoint.
